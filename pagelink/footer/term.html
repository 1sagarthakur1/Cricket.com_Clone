      </p>

      <h4>ERRORS, CHANGES AND UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SITE AND APPS</h4>
      <p>
        The contents and information published on the Site and the Apps may
        include inaccuracies or typographical errors from time to time. The
        Company may, but shall not be obliged, from time to time update the
        contents of the Site and the Apps. The Company does not guarantee the
        accuracy, completeness, reliability or currency of the contents and

        subject to these terms and conditions of use. If you are not happy with
        such changes, you can cease using the Site and the Apps. The Site and
        the Apps may be temporarily unavailable from time to time for various
        reasons including, without limitation, due to required maintenance,
        telecommunications interruptions, or other disruptions. As such, access
        to the Site and Apps are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis
        as set out below in the section entitled ‘Liability and
        Indemnification’. The Company will not be liable if for any reason the
        Site, the Apps or any part thereof is unavailable at any time.
      </p>

      <h4>SECURITY OF COMMUNICATIONS</h4>
      <p>
        Although we have taken all reasonable security precautions, the nature
        of communication via the Internet and other electronic means is such
        that we cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of any
        information relating to you passing by such methods. In accessing the
        Site and the Apps, you accept that communications may not be free from
        interference by third parties and may not remain confidential.

      <p>
        The Site and Apps may contain links to websites owned or operated by
        parties other than Crictec. Such links are provided for your convenience
        only. Crictec does not monitor or control outside websites and is not
        responsible for their content. Crictec’s inclusion of links to an
        outside website does not imply any endorsement of the material on our
        Site or Apps or, unless expressly disclosed otherwise, any sponsorship,
        affiliation or association with its owner, operator or sponsor.

        Company’s Site and/or Apps or for which the Company may, from time to
        time, send e-mail messages to you, will be governed by official rules
        that are separate from these terms and conditions of use. By
        participating in any such sweepstakes, contest or similar promotion, you
        will become subject to its specific official rules. Note, however, that

        reason, to suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Site
        and/or Apps at any time without notice, and without issuing any refunds

      </p>

      <h4>SEVERABILITY</h4>
      <p>
        To the extent that any provisions of these terms and conditions of use
        are held by any court or any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful
        or unenforceable, then such provision shall be severed, modified or
        deleted from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will
        continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

        provisions contained in these terms and conditions of use and those in
        any official rules for sweepstakes, contest or similar promotion, the
        official rules shall take precedence.
      </p>

      <h4>WAIVER</h4>
      <p>
        The failure by the Company to perform any of its obligations under these
        terms and conditions of use, or to exercise any of its rights or
        remedies under these terms and conditions of use, shall not constitute a
        waiver of such rights or remedies and shall not release you from
        compliance with such obligations. A waiver by the Company of any default
        by you shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent or future
        default. No waiver by the Company of any of your obligations under these
        terms and conditions of use shall be effective unless it is expressly
        stated to be a waiver and is communicated to you in writing.

        of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation
        (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and
        interpreted in accordance with the laws of Ireland. For the avoidance of
        doubt, mandatory consumer laws in the country in which you live shall
        continue to apply to these terms and conditions of use. The user and
        Crictec agree that the courts of Ireland shall have non-exclusive
        jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in

      "Former Supreme Court judge Vineet Saran has taken over as the BCCI's ethics officer and ombudsman, filling the dual posts lying vacant for a year. Saran has succeeded Justice (Retd) D K Jain, whose term ended in June last year. Honourable Justice Saran's appointment was made last month,a BCCI official told PTI.Saran, 65, is a former Chief Justice of Odisha High Court, and also served as a judge in Karnataka and Allahabad High Court. When contacted, Saran, who calls himself a cricket lover, said:I took charge last month, but I have not passed any order yet. After the IPL windfall, the BCCI Apex Council will prepare the ground for the home season media rights (2023 onwards) and a full-fledged domestic season after two years at its meeting on Thursday. The majority of the Apex Council meetings have been held virtually over the past two years due to COVID-19, but all members are likely to meet in person at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai.The 12-point agenda includes update on the 2022-2023 domestic season, gradation of umpires and media rights for cricket in India. Current rights holder Star India had paid Rs 6138.1 crore for the 2018-2023 cycle but the figure is set to go much higher considering the massive gains from the IPL media rights which fetched Rs 48390 crore. The media rights will be discussed as well as the upcoming domestic season, n official said. While the Ranji Trophy could not be held for the first time ever in 2021 due to the pandemic, it returned this year in curtailed form with teams getting to play only three league games. With the COVID-19 situation allowing the BCCI to do away with bubble both for international and domestic games, the domestic season is likely to be a full-fledged one The BCCI will also ratify the increase in pension of former cricketers after the announcement last month.",

      "South Africa go 1-0 upThat's a wrap from us tonight. England couldn't give a sweet farewell to Ben Stokes from ODI cricket. Instead, we saw terrific teamwork from South Africa today to go 1-0 up in the series. The series continues on Friday (July 22) with the second ODI in Manchester. Thanks for tuning in tonight. Rassie van der Dussen is player of the match ,Rassie van der Dussen is adjudged as the player of the match for his magnificent. Pretty hot today. We are used to it but it was quite dry and windy. We came into this series knowing we have to play smart cricket, physically it was hard but the game plan was to get into a good position and run hard. Markram played brilliantly, all the guys who came in showed great intent. We are pretty happy with the batting effort. We will see how we did tomorrow and be ready to go again in three days' time, he speaks on his performance today. Jos Buttler speaks on the defeat Tough day. The efforts were outstanding to field first in that heat. It was a good toss to win and we couldn't find those breakthroughs. A fantastic partnership. You need to take wickets to stem the flow in this format but they ran well and put us under pressure. We never quite managed to impose ourselves and the wicket got slower and lower, and tougher to time the ball. It wasn't through lack of trying. [Did you go hard enough?] I don't think it was a lack of effort. Those two at the top are explosive players but SA read the conditions well and were smart with the way they bowled. [Pressure on senior players with Morgan and Stokes gone?] We've been improving through the games we've played and we're missing experienced guys but that creates opportunities for others. Very confident in the team, says Buttler on a tough day at the office. He also spoke on Stokes' contribution to England's ODI fortunes: From all England fans, we want to say thank you for all that he's done for this team. He's been a fantastic ambassador in ODI cricket and we'll miss him. ",

      "Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels he can help Virat Kohli return back to his best by sorting his weakness outside off-stump. Kohli, who hasn't scored a century since November 2019, didn't have a great time in England.The right-hander could only manage 76 runs in six innings across formats, which included the rescheduled fifth Test, two ODIs and as many T20Is. He also missed the third T20I and the first ODI due to a groin injury. f I had about 20 minutes with him, I would be able to tell him the things he might have to do. It might help him, I am not saying it will help him but it could, particularly with regards to that off-stump line,  Gavaskar told India Today. Having been an opening batter, having been troubled by that line, there are certain things that you try and do. Kohli's lean patch has led to calls for his ouster from the T20 World Cup team, with even the legendary Kapil Dev voicing support for his exclusion. However, many former and current cricketers, including Babar Azam, Kevin Pietersen and Shoaib Akhtar have backed him to come good in the upcoming games. It goes back to the fact that his first mistake turns out to be his last. Again, just because he is not amongst the runs, there is this anxiety to play at every delivery because that is what batters feel, they have got to score, Gavaskar said. You look to play at deliveries that you otherwise won't. But he has gotten out to good deliveries as well on this particular tour. Kohli has been rested for the limited-overs series against West Indies which includes five T20Is and three ODIs Gavaskar also healped heavy praise on Rishabh Pant for batting responsibly in the third ODI against England. The wicketkeeper-batter scored a stunning century in the series-decider and helped India win the series 2-1. Rishabh Pant seems to have learned from his mistakes against South Africa. He chased balls outside off stump to slog them over the leg side then, but the way he batted with responsibility yesterday shows how well he paced his innings, the 73-year-old said. The way he smashed a flurry of boundaries towards the end showed that he is someone who can absorb pressure and then attack. We will need to wait and see (whether Pant is able to replicate this form in T20Is). He might have found the right template to play white ball cricket.",

      "Until 2016, a 21-year-old Ramsingh Sanjay Yadav was just like another budding cricketer in the Tamil Nadu circuit. While there was a section that was caught up with his exploits, there was a world in front of him that hadn’t. Enter the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL), the T20 league that was going to shape how the world looked at the 21-year-old. In six games that season, he had only 135 runs but there was a certain way that he went about during his stay at the crease. Tamil Nadu has often been a state that has been synonymous with ‘touch players’, but Sanjay was having none of that. He possessed a power that could clear any boundary with ease and played with freedom that the tournament represented. Despite that, he still hadn’t caught the attention of everyone. But his ongoing stint with Mumbai Indians made him wilier, experienced and stronger. While opportunities came few and far at the Indian Premier League (IPL) stage, Sanjay was more interested in putting that experience to his reputation.In the Tamil Nadu cricketing circuit, Sanjay was by now already known as a fearsome hitter. But still, there was this hunger that was there in the left-hander that was to be filled. Gone were the preying days, it was a time for the feast. When he stepped out at the India Cement Ground in Tirunelveli, there was a new Sanjay, one that was now enriched with regular conversations with the Mumbai Indians’ street-smart minds. And when his brother, Sonu Yadav, removed Baba Indrajith, the scene was set. It was the battle of the two Yadav brothers. Sometimes, the best adrenaline is when the battle is with high-stakes, this one was perhaps one in the Yadav household, who several years before had moved from Gorakhpur to Hosur. It was the younger brother Sonu vs the elder brother, Sanjay. Against the defending champions, Chepauk Super Gillies, Sanjay was ready. When he marked his stance, there was something that said that the Eagle was coming. When he casually flicked one off the pads, even Subramaniam Badrinath, the commentator, could not believe his eyes. It raced away to the boundary in a fraction of seconds. That was how Sanjay played his cricket. He combined power with touch, aggression with consistency and IPL experience into a truck-load of runs in the TNPL. The 27-year-old is as powerful as a batter could get against spin. In fact, since 2020 TNPL, the left-hander has scored 146 runs against spinners at a strike-rate of 173.81, scoring a six every seventh ball.   ",

      "In the second Ashes Test at Edgbaston in 2005, Michael Kasprowicz gloved a rising delivery from Steve Harmison to Geraint Jones behind the stumps. The umpire, Billy Bowden raised his crooked finger to a vociferous appeal. That was the last Australian wicket remaining. They lost a nail-biter by 2 runs. The replays suggested that Kasprowicz’s hand was off the bat when he gloved the bouncer. According to the rule book, he was not out. However, it was nearly impossible for Bowden to spot that in the split second during which the ball passed the batsman. It was quite similar to marginal run-out and stumping decisions, called by the on-field umpires until 1992. They did so standing yards away from the action with the event taking place in a fraction of a second. In cricket’s first introduction to technology, the third umpire (or TV umpire) was employed to assist the on-field umpires to make such decisions through TV replays. It turned out to be an extremely helpful exercise, becoming a necessity in modern-day cricket. Fast forward to January 2008, Cricket Australia’s chief executive, James Sutherland told the Australian,There have been some advances in technology that cricket can continue to explore Sutherland’s comments came during the course of a controversial Test match between Australia and India in Sydney. The match constituted a series of howlers by umpires Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson. It led to a furore and Bucknor, who was supposed to officiate in the subsequent Test was sent back home. Sutherland advocated the concept of player referrals after a second consecutive poor day for the umpires. By March, ICC approved the trial of the review system during a Test series in the calendar year. The England and South Africa boards failed to reach an agreement to implement the new system in the 2008 Basil D'Oliveira Trophy. But Sri Lanka and India agreed. The Umpire Decision Review System (popular as DRS) made its debut on this day in 2008 at SSC, Colombo. ",

      "Class, resilience, watertight technique, sublime wristwork, and all these with a tinge of Caribbean flair. In their 45-year long history in international cricket, Sri Lanka, despite being a small island nation, has presented all flavors of batsmanship. Resilience has been common across all their greats representing the fight in the country to stay relevant which was marred with Civil War for 27 years. Kumar Sangakkara had all the aforementioned qualities in copious amounts. Except, he did not have the Caribbean flamboyance but replaced it with his unshakeable focus. The focus was implanted in Sangakkara at an early age by his father, Kshema, who would feed him uncountable throwdowns in the backyard, fixating on minor body movements for months. The pedantic nature of his father was conspicuous when despite scoring 197 in a school game, Sangakkara was castigated by him in front of his teammates for getting out to a bad shot instead of getting an attaboy. This was after Sangakkara excelled in badminton and tennis too but had circled back to cricket on the advice of his school principal Playing school cricket at all age groups, the left-hander made an impression right from the beginning. The greats of Sri Lankan cricket had their eyes on him and the southpaw justified the attention by scoring 156* for Sri Lanka A in a List-A game against Zimbabwe. He was fast tracked into Sri Lanka’s ODI side, making his debut on this day in 2000 in the first ODI against Pakistan at Galle. Couple of weeks later, he was given his maiden Test cap, in the first Test against South Africa.Sustaining the position at the top is always tougher than reaching the summit. The focus attained after tireless sessions with his father would now come in handy. Sangakkara did not have a great start to his career. He showed a hint of his resolve but numbers did not do justice to the talent he promised. While in Tests, his average jumped to 46.6 by the end of 2001 from 24.9 in four Tests in 2000, in ODIs, it fell to 22.3 after ending 2000 at 42.4.  ",

One of the most iconic on-field friendships in world cricket, easily one of the highest significance in Sri Lankan cricket, them batting together was cricket’s equivalent of a classical music show. Quite fittingly, they hold the record for the highest partnership in Test and first-class cricket. ",

      "Imagine planning a vacation to the US with an all-expenses paid stopover in England. But during the stopover, you win a World Cup and now the trip is cancelled because you have to celebrate with the team. This is what happened to Krishnamachari Srikkanth. Married at the end of March 1983, he was eyeing the World Cup as a stopover to a second honeymoon in the states. A lot of other players in the squad, including Sunil Gavaskar, were also a part of this expedition. Likewise, the newbies in the side were excited for sightseeing on their first trip to England. In the previous two editions combined, India had only one win - against East Africa, now an extinct identity in cricketing history. They lost to Sri Lanka in 1979, an associate nation back then. Overall, India had an ordinary 20 percent win record in ODIs till the beginning of the World Cup campaign on June 9. No one, including the team themselves, gave India a chance to even reach the semi-finals. The Campaign However, India kicked off their campaign with a resounding win over the tournament favorites, West Indies at Old Trafford. Middle-order batsman, Yashpal Sharma scored a resilient 89, propelling India to 262. The bowlers did their job efficiently (Ravi Shastri and Roger Binny taking three scalps each) bundling out West Indies for 228. But India still did not believe. It seemed more of a one-time upset until they heard the result of another World Cup game from 100 miles away in Trent Bridge. Zimbabwe had defeated Australia on their World Cup debut which meant the Indians now had a chance to sneak into the semis. They defeated Zimbabwe in their next game at Leicester and suddenly a non-existent dream was alive. But that also made the team conscious. Where they were expressing themselves earlier without anything to lose, Indians were humbled in their subsequent games by Australia (lost by 162 runs) and West Indies (lost by 66 runs in the second round-robin match). During all these ebbs and flows, one man who believed that the World Cup trophy was attainable was their skipper, Kapil Dev. He was only 24 years old, in his first season as captain replacing the legendary Gavaskar in the role but managed to motivate a side of youngsters to march ahead. All it took was an innings arguably considered as the greatest ODI knock of all-time and certainly one of the best in Indian cricket history.",

      one: "n a virtual knockout game at Tunbridge Wells against Zimbabwe, Kapil walked in to bat with four wickets down for only 9 runs on the board. It soon became 17 for five. India’s campaign, after beginning on a high, was staring at a miserable end. Kapil pulled off a miraculous 175* off 138 balls, launching India to 266 for eight while batting with the lower order. It was also the first time an Indian batsman had reached triple figures in ODI cricket. With three more World Cup fixtures on the day, this contest between two minnow nations gained minimum attraction. BBC did not bother to telecast it; hence, keeping the world bereft of any video footage of Kapil’s devilry.  Kapil had lit up India’s campaign. The tonic of belief the innings served to his teammates was just what the doctor ordered. India won the game by 31 runs and romped Australia by 118 runs in the subsequent game. Playing the hosts, England, in the semi-final, the middle-order trio of Mohinder Amarnath (46), Yashpal Sharma (61) and Sandeep Patil (51*) saw India over the line in a run-chase of 213.  The Final Whether it was the supremacy of that West Indies side or the underdog tag laid against India, the final was considered a formality with odds heavily in favor of Clive Lloyd’s team winning their third title. India lost the toss on a green track and were put in to bat first. Kapil turned away gulping the disappointment of losing the toss while Lloyd chuckled with the prospect of his bowling attack comprising Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall making the first use of the grass cover. To Kapil’s fear, the Indian innings never took off. Gavaskar was the first man out for 2. Srikkanth, whose initial plans would have had him in the US by now, was the highest contributor to the innings scoring 38. There were no heroics from Kapil this time who played one shot too many trying to up the ante against the spinners. He ended up giving catching practice to the long-on fielder for 15. ",
      two: "Kapil popped the champagne on the Lord’s balcony before replacing it with a bottle of milk in his hands. At 24, he was a World Cup winning captain. But it was only when they returned home they realized the impact of their victory. At the Mumbai Airport, they were welcomed to unprecedented scenes in Indian cricket - thousands of fans at the airport, people jumping over each other to catch a glimpse of the team bus and jam packed stands during the team's victory lap at the Wankhede stadium. Moreover, the win inspired the Indian population to look at cricket with adulation. At the same time, it fed youngsters with the desire to take up cricket, setting the foundation for future India cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and many more. Witnessing how the celebrations had gripped the nation, the big money-spenders realized the potential the game holds in the country and money flew in through different routes that made BCCI the richest board in the world in two decades’ time. Back in England, David Frith, the editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly, who had given the Indian team no chance in his preview for the tournament was asked by a reader back in USA to eat his words. In a sporting act, Frith did the needful and was photographed by WCM ‘eating his words’ with a glass of wine in his hands to clear his throat.",

      "Rassie van der Dussen's century helped South Africa spoil Ben Stokes's farewell to One-Day International cricket as the Proteas won by 62 runs on the England star's Durham home ground to go 1-0 up in a three-match series. Van der Dussen's career-best 134 was the cornerstone of South Africa's 335-5, their highest ODI total in England. He also shared stands of 109 with opener Janneman Malan (57) and 151 with Aiden Markram, who made a stylish 77. Test captain Stokes did not have a fairytale finish to a 50-over international cricket career that peaked with a player of the match display in England's 2019 World Cup final triumph. The struggling 31-year-old paceman took an expensive 0-44 in five overs amid searing heat, after being cheered by his loyal home fans as he led England onto the field. Stokes then made just five with the bat before he was lbw to off-spinner Markram, having missed a reverse sweep. Stokes had announced on Monday that this game would be his 105th and last match at this level, with the dynamic all-rounder saying a congested England fixture schedule meant he had to jettison ODIs in order to still give of his best in Tests and Twenty20s. Fellow World Cup-winner Jos Buttler, now England's white-ball captain, thanked Stokes for his ODI efforts. Three years ago (the 2019 World Cup final) will live long in the memory but every day he turns up, whether that be for training or in a match, he puts in 100 percent ,Joe Root took up the charge after Stokess dismissal with a run-a-ball fifty. But a target of 103 off the last eight overs, with England already six wickets down, was too much even for the world top-ranked Test batsman.Root was eventually bowled for an excellent 86 by express quick Anrich Nortje, who finished with 4-53 from 8.5 overs. Earlier, van der Dussen's leg-glanced boundary off Curran saw him to a 90-ball hundred including nine fours. It was the 33-year-old's third century in 36 ODIs and first against England. He surpassed his previous highest ODI score of 129 not out against India at Paarl in January this year before he was bowled by a Liam Livingstone delivery that kept low two balls after the spinner dismissed Markram. The series continues at Old Trafford on Friday.",

Pakistan ended day four on 222 for three, still needing 120 runs to take the lead in the two-match series at Galle, where the highest successful fourth-innings chase is 268 by Sri Lanka against New Zealand in 2019. Shafique, batting on 112, and skipper Babar Azam, who made 55, put together 101 runs for the third wicket but spinner Prabath Jayasuriya broke through just a few overs before the close of play. Jayasuriya bowled talisman Azam with his left-arm spin around the batsman's legs with a delivery that spun sharply from outside leg to rattle the stumps of the right-hander, who looked visibly shocked. Wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Rizwan was batting on seven at stumps alongside Shafique, who had so far faced 289 balls and hit five boundaries and one six. Pakistan began strongly with an 87-run partnership between Shafique and fellow opener Imam-ul-Haq, who made 35, but an alert stumping from wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella broke the stand .The left-handed Imam missed a delivery from off-spinner Ramesh Mendis and Dickwella clipped off the bails, with the decision going up to the third umpire. After different TV angles it was established that Imam's foot was just millimetres off the ground when the bails were dislodged. Azhar Ali was the next to go when he edged a ball from Jayasuriya to first slip. He made six off 32 deliveries. Azam, who hit a defiant 119 in Pakistan's first-innings total of 218, then joined Shafique as the two rebuilt the innings on a turning pitch. Azam reached his fifty and two balls later Shafique got his second Test hundred with a single off Maheesh Theekshana, raising his bat to a standing ovation from the dressing room. Azam, who crossed 10,000 international runs on day two and averages over 45, went past 3,000 Test runs during another stubborn knock. Jayasuriya, who claimed a five-wicket haul in the previous innings, kept up the pressure with his turners and sliders. Sri Lanka took the second new ball in the 81st over but the spinners kept up the attack in the final few tense overs of the day. In the morning, Sri Lanka resumed the day on 329-9 in their second innings. Dinesh Chandimal was stranded on 94 when they were all out for 337.",

      "A couple of days after the series decider at Old Trafford against India, England are all set to rekindle their rivalry against South Africa, starting with the first ODI on Tuesday, July 19, at Chester-le-Street in Durham. With the increasing debate surrounding the future of the fifty-over format, the match will be followed by every England fan as Durham's favourite son, Ben Stokes, will bid adieu to ODI cricket after playing his final game at his home ground. I will play my last game for England in ODI cricket on Tuesday in Durham. I have decided to retire from this format. While the news of Stokes announcing his retirement shocked the cricketing pundits across the globe, it was something most people expected, considering the increasing need to manage his workload after being picked to lead England to a new era in the red-ball format. Three formats are just unsustainable for me now,revealed the Test skipper as he aims to focus his energies on helping the team scale greater heights in the remaining two formats. n a career spanning over a decade, Stokes emerged as the notorious boy of England cricket, with his off-field controversies taking centre stage in the initial years at the international level. While he was born in Christchurch in 1991, Stokes moved to England at the tender age of 12 and honed his skills at the Cockermouth Cricket Club before graduating to play for Durham in the County Championship.  With consistent performances in the domestic circuit making the noises for all the right reasons, Stokes made his debut for the national side against Ireland in a fifty-over game in Dublin. Despite managing to score only three runs in his maiden appearance, Stokes was touted as the player to watch out for in the future. However, with diminishing returns at the international level, Stokes struggled to cement his place in the playing XI of the side in the white-ball format. A string of low scores in the T20Is against West Indies a couple of weeks before the T20 World Cup in 2014 resulted in the southpaw losing his cool. Stokes smashed a locker after being dismissed for a golden duck in the final game of the series by a slower delivery from Krishmar Santokie.   ",

      "Extended space in the International calendar for the Indian Premier League. South Africa forfeited their series against Australia for a secured future. Cricket Australia decided to create a space in their calendar for BBL. The Hundred becomes England’s crowning jewel and wouldn’t clash with their home summer. Yes, all of these happened in the span of a week as cricket boards have taken a giant leap towards acknowledging the fact that the sport is nothing but pure commerce. There is no more hiding behind the oblivious account of “Country vs Country” still being the pinnacle of the sport. Just over a month after the Indian Premier League accounted for close to 6.2 Billion USD in lieu of a five-year broadcasting rights, we are finally here to witness other boards moving goal posts to find themselves relevant in the landscape, and surviving the clout that comes with the idea of BCCI and its big cheques.  Then what is the way forward? The FTP is impacted and the ODI Super League is scrapped. While India and Australia are slated to play five Test matches against each other in a gap of every two years, other small nations are scratching the end of the barrel for something of their own. The inequitable balance has ensured the quality of international cricket being monotonous and the finances being in tatters. In such a situation, can you really blame the boards like Cricket South Africa, who are set to launch their own T20 league this year, and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for deciding to add two more teams to the roster? It is the modern-day reality of the sport we all have to be content with, even though that comes at a cost. My colleague Aakash explored how franchise cricket has become the future of the sport and last week certainly rang a bell for the cricket’s afficinados.  However, the biggest concern remains. Take Cricket South Africa for example. Multiple false starts and a failed T20 league later, they are planning to add some juice to their system. The newly-designed tournament is understood as the lifeline to keep their books in order. They went as far as canceling their series against Australia, losing the 30 points available for the series. As difficult as this decision has been for CSA, the long-term sustainability of our new T20 League is reliant on having all our domestic players available for this exciting new addition to the CSA calendar, CSA chief executive Pholetsi Moseki said in a statement.",

      "India’s bowling problems with the new ball was a well-documented reality. Prior to Rahul Dravid taking over the coaching role, India had only picked up 20 wickets in the powerplay, averaging a high 80, the worst-record amongst the top-ten sides in the 50-over format since the 2019 World Cup. Even the likes of Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Deepak Chahar amidst others could not pick up early wickets for India.That was perhaps a key area that needed immediate change for India’s fortunes. Since November 2021, India have the best average with the new ball, at 23.6, picking up 18 wickets, the most for any sides in the time period. To add to that, the Indian bowlers also have the best strike-rate in the powerplay, at 30. Leading India’s charge have been Mohammed Siraj and Bumrah, who have picked up nine wickets in between them. In the 2-1 series win over England, India’s new-ball bowling was perhaps the biggest differentiator between the two sides. With the new ball, India averaged just 15.8, picking up nine wickets in comparison to England’s five. Slowly yet steadily, India are tackling one of their biggest hurdles in ODI cricket – new-ball wickets.  Pandya’s all-round show puts India in strong place",

      "Glenn Phillips' quick-fire 69 and four wickets from Lockie Ferguson inspired New Zealand's 31-run win over Ireland in their opening Twenty20 international on Monday. Phillips was unbeaten in his 52-ball innings as he smashed seven boundaries in New Zealand's total of 173 for eight. Jimmy Neesham kept the runs flowing for New Zealand with a rapid 29, which included a towering six into the sightscreen. Ferguson turned the screw on Ireland in their chase with impressive figures of 4-14 as the hosts were bowled out for 142 in 18.2 overs. Ireland, who just missed out on a first-ever victory over New Zealand when they lost the final ODI by one run last week, elected to field first in Dublin. It had looked a solid call when New Zealand opener Finn Allen fell for one in the third over off Joshua Little, who finished with four wickets. Martin Guptill (24) soon followed after he holed out at long off, and Dane Cleaver (five) lasted only seven deliveries on his debut, nicking a length ball from Little behind.  Daryl Mitchell was also dismissed for five off Curtis Campher to leave the tourists struggling at 54 for four in the ninth over. Phillips nipped Ireland's threat in the bud with his flamboyant stroke-play, and New Zealand got an early breakthrough in the field when Mitchell Santner claimed a fine catch to dismiss Andy Balbirnie for 12. Black Caps skipper Santner took two wickets with the ball to reduce Ireland to 69 for five in the 10th over. Campher (29) and Mark Adair (25) gave Ireland faint hope, but Ferguson ensured the chase proved too much for the hosts. Brief Scores: New Zealand: 173-8 (20 overs) Phillips 69 not out, Little 4-35, Adair 2-49 Ireland: 142 (18.2 overs) ,Ferguson 4-14, Neesham 2-19, Santner 2-36 ,New Zealand won by 31 runs",
